      title: "Do I own the precious metals I buy on WARET GOLD?",
      desc: "You own 100% of the products you buy on WARET GOLD. All your stored products are physically kept in our secure vaults and off our balance sheet, so you remain their unique legal owner even if WARET GOLD were to cease its business activities. Indeed, WARET GOLD only sells allocated precious metals that belong entirely to you. Other resellers can sell “mutualized” gold, often as a 12.5 kg bar shared with other customers. Although a part of it technically belongs to you, it can be difficult to resell and is usually not available to redeem. Some resellers even sell “paper gold”, which is not physical gold itself but an asset reflecting the price of gold and not necessarily backed by real physical gold.",

      title: "Is there any guarantee for my purchases on WARET GOLD?",
      desc: "All precious metals bars sold on WARET GOLD are sealed and come with a purity certificate. We also provide a downloadable certificate of ownership for each stored product and a printable invoice with each purchase. This way, you always have paper proof of your ownership. Minted bars come with the CertiPAMP packaging which serves as their purity certificate. We advise leaving these products in their sealed packaging to ensure the validity of their purity certificate. Some of our products also come with the Veriscan technology, an MKS PAMP SA application used to securely identify precious metals products and their purity.",

      title:
        "What are the fees and commissions when I buy, store, or sell on WARET GOLD?",
      desc: "Like any precious metals reseller, we charge a margin (also called “premium”) on each product, it`s the part of the price that covers our costs and reseller's margin. This margin is already included in the prices you see in our shop. To better understand how the price of a product works, simply click on it to see a detailed breakdown. Any product you store with us is fully insured against loss, theft, and damage, for free. Storage is also free for up to CHF10,000 in storage value, and if you want to store larger quantities, you only pay a fixed fee of CHF8/month up to CHF100,000 in storage value. And that’s it. That’s the only fees we will charge on WARET GOLD. At resale, we do not take any fee or commission and offer instant buyback, at spot price for all the products you store with us. This means that we will pay you the full market price for your product, whenever you want to sell. You can read more about this on our storage solution page.",

      title: "Why should I save in gold in 2024?",
      desc: "While the gold price has seen fluctuations in 2021, it has increased by over 60% in the past 5 years, and gold has historically performed well in times of inflation and economic uncertainty.Today, investors often buy gold for two reasons. First, to secure their savings instead of leaving their money in a savings account to be eaten away by inflation. Then, to diversify their portfolio and protect it against risks they might take elsewhere (stocks, cryptocurrencies, real estate, etc.) Many buyers also choose to save gold on a regular basis to smooth out the changes in price that can happen in the short to medium term. Saving in gold is a way to secure your savings and build wealth on the long term.
